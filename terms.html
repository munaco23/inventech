        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

        <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
        <p>By accessing our website or engaging our services (the “Services”), you agree to these Terms & Conditions (“Terms”). If you are acting on behalf of a company, you confirm you have authority to bind that company.</p>

        <h3>2. Engagement & Scope</h3>
        <p>Project scope, deliverables, timelines, and pricing are defined in a written Order, Proposal, or Statement of Work (SOW). Discovery may refine scope; material changes require written approval and may affect cost and schedule.</p>

        <h3>3. Fees, Invoicing & Payments</h3>
        <p>Unless specified otherwise, Services are billed on a time‑and‑materials basis. Invoices are due within the stated term. Late or unpaid invoices may pause delivery and delay handover. Out‑of‑scope requests will be quoted separately.</p>

        <h3>4. Client Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>You agree to provide timely access to stakeholders, systems, content, and approvals. Delays in feedback or dependencies may shift milestones. You warrant that all materials supplied are lawful and do not infringe third‑party rights.</p>

        <h3>5. Deliverables & Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>Upon full and final payment, ownership of bespoke deliverables transfers to you. Our pre‑existing IP (methods, libraries, tools, boilerplate) and open‑source or third‑party components remain under their respective licenses. We may reuse general know‑how not specific to your confidential information.</p>

        <h3>6. Open‑Source & Third‑Party Services</h3>
        <p>We may integrate open‑source packages, APIs, SaaS, hosting, and plugins. Their terms, pricing, support, and availability are governed by the respective providers and are outside our control. You are responsible for ongoing third‑party fees unless stated otherwise.</p>

        <h3>7. Approvals & Acceptance</h3>
        <p>We present work in milestones for review. If no written issues are raised within five (5) business days of delivery, the work is deemed accepted. Reported issues will be addressed in line with the SOW and severity.</p>

        <h3>8. Maintenance & Support</h3>
        <p>Post‑launch maintenance, upgrades, and feature requests are separate from build scope unless a support plan is purchased. We may recommend updates to maintain security, performance, and compatibility.</p>

        <h3>9. Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>Each party will protect the other’s confidential information with reasonable care and use it only to perform the Services. Confidentiality does not apply to information that is public, already known, independently developed, or rightfully obtained from a third party.</p>

        <h3>10. Data Protection & Security</h3>
        <p>Where we process personal data on your behalf, you act as Controller and we act as Processor. Each party must comply with applicable data‑protection laws. We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures, but no system is entirely secure.</p>

        <h3>11. Warranties & Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Except as expressly stated in an SOW, the Services and deliverables are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non‑infringement.</p>

        <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, loss of profits, data, or business interruption. Our aggregate liability is limited to the fees you paid for the Services giving rise to the claim in the preceding twelve (12) months.</p>

        <h3>13. Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You will defend and indemnify us against claims arising from your content, misuse of the Services, or violation of law or third‑party rights.</p>

        <h3>14. Suspension & Termination</h3>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access for material breach, non‑payment, fraud, or security risks. Either party may terminate an SOW for cause if the other party fails to cure a material breach within ten (10) days of written notice. You will pay for Services rendered up to termination.</p>

        <h3>15. Non‑Solicitation (Optional)</h3>
        <p>During the engagement and for six (6) months thereafter, neither party will solicit for employment the other party’s personnel directly involved in the project without prior written consent.</p>

        <h3>16. Changes to the Services & Terms</h3>
        <p>We may modify the Services and update these Terms. Material changes will be communicated by updating the “Last updated” date and, where appropriate, via notice. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>

        <h3>17. Governing Law & Disputes</h3>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Pakistan. Courts located in Lahore, Pakistan shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes.</p>
